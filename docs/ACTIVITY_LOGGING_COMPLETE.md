## 📱 Example Use Cases

### Security Audit
```sql
-- Find all admin actions in last 7 days
SELECT * FROM "user"."ActivityLog"
WHERE "createdAt" > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
AND "userId" IN (SELECT id FROM "user"."User" WHERE role = 'ADMIN')
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC;
```

### Device Activity Report
```sql
-- Count device actions per day
SELECT 
  DATE("createdAt") as date,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM "user"."ActivityLog"
WHERE "logType" = 'DEVICE'
GROUP BY DATE("createdAt")
ORDER BY date DESC;

### User Activity Summary
```sql
-- Most active users
SELECT 
  u."fullName",
  u."email",
  COUNT(al.id) as activity_count
FROM "user"."ActivityLog" al
JOIN "user"."User" u ON al."userId" = u.id
GROUP BY u.id, u."fullName", u."email"
ORDER BY activity_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
